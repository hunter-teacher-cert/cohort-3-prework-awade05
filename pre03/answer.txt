1. No, I wug. You wugga wug. I wug. (The main first prints the out put No, I then it calls zoop. zoop calls baffle first. baffle prints the word wug then calls ping() which prints a period. zoop then prints You wuggs and then calls baffle again which prints wug and calls ping which prints the period again. We then go back to main which prints I and then calls baffle again which prints wug and calls print which prints the period.)

2. main 
   zoop
   baffle
   ping

   If you invoke baffle at the end of ping then it will keep going back and forth between baffle and ping looping.
